## **Alias**, a word game. 

That's a team competitive game, where a chosen members of one team have to explain as much words as they can to their teammates in a short period of time. One that reaches the max amount of points first wins the competition!

## Basic functionality includes:

- basic game mechanics (including built-in and custom round tasks);
- word packages management (built-in and custom);
- team management;
- game settings;
- post-round statistics;

The UX wireframe is created via Figma. You can find a copy of [here](https://github.com/AVPa1ly/IT-DDP/blob/ux-design/Mockup/Mockup.fig).
